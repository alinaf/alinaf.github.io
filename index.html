    <div class="about">
      Here are some (not yet mobile-friendly) game prototypes made using Phaser 3! <a href="https://labs.phaser.io/">Phaser Labs</a> was my go-to resource.

    <div class="game">
      <img src="img/banana.gif" alt="banana snake" />
      <h3> word snake </h3>
      <a href="https://alinaf.github.io/bananasnake/">play</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/alinaf/bananasnake">code</a> <br><br>
      I made this because I wanted to make a word game, and all I could find were snake tutorials. Spell out "banana", and continue tacking on alternating "n"s and "a"s. The game ends when you repeat a letter or the snake eats itself.<br><br>

      This was the first game I ever made!

    <div class="game">
      <img src="img/grams.png" alt="grabble" />
      <h3> grabble </h3>
      <a href="https://scram.herokuapp.com/">play</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/alinaf/alinaf.github.io/tree/002b664a6025cbe7df08815c7ee65c039fab6291">code</a> <br><br>
      Grabble is a 2-player word game in which players make words from a communal tile bank, and can steal each other's words by adding to them and/or rearranging them. This is my favorite board game, and I play with Bananagrams tiles. Grabble uses Heroku + Node.js!<br><br>

      To play, press the start button after you and a friend have both launched the <a href="https://scram.herokuapp.com/">site</a>.

    <div class="game">
      <img src="img/fem.png" alt="fem theory" />
      <h3> french gender game </h3>
      <a href="https://alinaf.github.io/fem-game/">play</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/alinaf/fem-game">code</a> <br><br>
      I made this game for a feminist theory class, and it highlights gender bias and inconsistencies in the French language. Click through a quiz, view your results, and play four mini games that showcase different aspects of the issue.<br><br>
